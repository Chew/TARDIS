                </ul>

        </ul>
        <h4>Fixes</h4>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>If <code>rooms_require_blocks</code> was true and the <code>rooms_condenser_percentage</code> was low, there was a chance that you would be required to condense a zero amount of a block. The minimum will now always be at least 1.</li>
            <li>Added SPIDER_EYE to the condensable items list</li>
            <li>Fixed the &lsquo;baker&rsquo; and &lsquo;wood&rsquo; rooms requiring players to condense a CAKE_BLOCK if <code>rooms_require_blocks</code> was true</li>

        <h3>v2.3-beta-1</h3>

            <li>The default for the config option <code>rooms_require_blocks</code> is now <code>false</code></li>
            <li>Fixed the update checker giving the wrong message if a release version is available and the current version is a beta</li>

                    <li>Using the back door requires Artron Energy &mdash; set the cost with the config option <code>backdoor</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Companions can now enter the TARDIS at any time (The Time Lord of the TARDIS does not have to be inside)</li>
            <li>Added <strong>isomorphic controls</strong> so that Time Lords can lock the controls and prevent companions from stealing the TARDIS
                <ul>
                    <li>use the command <code>/tardisprefs isomorphic [on|off]</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added the permission <code>tardis.exterminate</code> &mdash; players must have it to delete their TARDIS</li>
            <li>Fixed some levers falling into the void (causing inactive lamps) in deluxe &amp; eleventh TARDIS schematics &mdash; <em>delete the old schematics</em></li>
            <li>Fixed the handbrake not being added in the deluxe TARDIS schematic &mdash; <em>delete the old schematic</em></li>
            <li>Added missing condensable <code>*_ITEM</code> items for cauldrons, brewing stands and nether_bricks to the condensables list. This should fix some rooms not being able to be grown when <code>rooms_require_blocks</code> is <code>true</code></li>
            <li>Added the ability for functional secondary control consoles
                <ul>
                    <li>Old primary controls are automatically updated to the new format</li>

                    <li>Growing a <em>baker</em> or <em>wood</em> secondary console room automatically adds functional secondary controls &mdash; <em>delete the old room schematics</em></li>

            </li>
            <li>Added a player preference to only have the TARDIS beacon on while travelling &mdash; <code>/tardisprefs beacon [on|off]</code>

                    <li>In new TARDISes the beacon is off until the Artron Energy Capacitor is initialised by clicking the Artron button with the TARDIS key &mdash; <em>delete the old schematics</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Removed all reliance on NMS and OCB methods
                <ul>
                    <li>this means that offline players no longer have their location set to the server&rsquo;s default world spawn point (probably a non-issue as spawn is usually controlled by another plugin anyway e.g. Essentials Spawn)</li>
                    <li>this also means that the plugin will not break with every CraftBukkit update :)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a NPE when trying the rename the TARDIS key when it is AIR</li>

            <li> Fixed not being able to condense certain items when growing rooms and <code>rooms_require_blocks</code> is true</li>
            <li> Fixed a farm room floor block not being replaced with the player&rsquo;s preferred floor block</li>
            <li> The platform is destroyed properly when deleting the TARDIS</li>
            <li> Adjusted the malfunction timing and changed the way that the lamps are made to flicker on and off</li>
            <li> Added <code>/tardis lamps</code> command to allow TARDISes created prior to v2.2 to have malfunctioning lamps</li>
            <li> Added Redstone blocks in the TARDIS to the protected block list</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>v2.2-beta-2</h3>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel to a previously saved destination in The End or the Nether is denied if they are disabled in the config or the player doesn&rsquo;t have permission.</li>

        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>The Gravity Well is now one block taller/deeper to accommodate growing rooms underneath the &lsquo;arboretum&rsquo; room</li>
            <li>The ICE blocks in the &lsquo;pool&rsquo; room are now thawed upon room completion</li>

            <li>Added a TARDIS scanner &mdash; this can be a button or lever &mdash; use the <code>/tardis update scanner</code> command to add it. The scanner will tell you about the location of the current saved destination/current Police Box location (if no destination has been set). It includes information on the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The world and co-ordinates</li>
                    <li>Biome type</li>
                    <li>Time of day</li>

            </li>
            <li>Added player preference to set the block used to grow room walls &mdash; use <code>/tardisprefs wall help</code> to see a list of available blocks. The preference is automatically set when creating the TARDIS &mdash; default, bigger and deluxe sizes are set to ORANGE_WOOL and the eleventh to LIGHT_GREY_WOOL if using LAPIS as the middle block (in the creation stack). Otherwise it is set the the material used for the middle block.</li>
            <li>If the config contains <code>debug: true</code>, rooms grow faster</li>
            <li>The TARDIS condenser now accepts most blocks and items for conversion. You get more energy for items of higher worth e.g. if the value of DIRT = 1, then a diamond = 200</li>
            <li>You can no longer use the <code>/tardis comehere</code> command to bring the Police Box to a predefined TARDIS area &mdash; this should stop potential overlaps and dupes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-8</h3>
        <p>Big thanks to <strong>vistaero</strong> for finding a whole bunch of bugs and making a video so we can fix them :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The default Artron Energy values have been adjusted &mdash; rename your old config file and let the plugin regenerate a new one if you want to see them</li>
            <li>Fixed some inconsistencies with the Emerald TARDIS</li>
            <li>You can no longer set a destination while the Handbrake is off &mdash; this includes using the random location button, any &lsquo;bound&rsquo; buttons, the save sign, and the <code>/tardistravel</code> commands</li>
            <li>If random location finding times out &mdash; due to the area defined by the repeater settings being protected by another plugin (such as WorldGuard) &mdash; then the player is messaged and no destination is saved</li>
            <li>The plugin no longer nags you about the TARDIS key if you click on a non-TARDIS iron door with blue wool on the top of it</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardisadmin include [world]</code> command</li>

            <li>The platform (if there is one) is destroyed correctly when using <code>/tardis comehere</code></li>
            <li>Optimised some of the various TARDIS Listener classes to (hopefully) reduce server lag</li>
            <li>You can now add more than one gravity well to the TARDIS. Technically you can make one go up a level, but you&rsquo;ll have to be a bit creative&hellip;
                <ul>
                    <li>This breaks the current gravity wells so they will need updating</li>
                    <li>Added <code>/tardis gravity</code> command to update old gravity wells to the new format. Use the command while inside your TARDIS &mdash; changes should take effect immediately</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added some debug info for the EntityExplodeEvent Listener</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the <code>/tardis check_loc</code> and <code>/tardisarea show</code> marker block to SNOW instead of GLOWSTONE</li>
            <li>Made the Beacon recharge amount a percentage of the <code>full_charge</code> config value</li>
            <li>The handbrake can no longer be clicked on/off while the TARDIS is materialising &mdash; fixes dupe bug #1</li>
            <li>The TARDIS now uses the correct location to destroy the Police Box when a destination has been set but not used &mdash; fixes dupe bug #2</li>
            <li>If <code>materialise: true</code> is set in the config, the Police Box now rebuilds correctly &mdash; fixes dupe bug #3</li>
            <li>The Police Box is now impervious to FIREBALLs</li>
            <li>Multiverse no longer tries to adjust the TARDIS world spawn point (TARDIS sets it itself)</li>
            <li>Mistyping or using an invalid room name no longer throws an error</li>
            <li>if <code>give_key: true</code> is set in the config the TARDIS will give a key to players when entering the TARDIS as well as exiting, should they not have one in their inventory</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The precious blocks under the TARDIS beacon are now protected properly from harvesting after travelling for the first time<br />
                <strong>Note</strong> this will only be in effect for newly created TARDISs</li>
            <li>The spawn point of TARDIS worlds is now set inside the TARDIS, so no more falling to your death in the void if you die and respawn in your TARDIS.<br />
                <strong>Note</strong> this will only be in effect for newly created TARDISs + untested with MultiWorld plugin</li>
            <li>Improved messaging when clicking on the door and handbrake while travelling</li>
            <li>The plugin now properly respects the <code>give_key</code> config option</li>
            <li>The <code>full_charge</code> config value is now used where it should be</li>
            <li>The EMERALD/Eleventh TARDIS schematic now sets the handbrake block correctly &mdash; please delete the old schematic and CSV file</li>
            <li>You can no longer use the commands: <code>/tardis come here</code>, <code>/tardis home</code>, and <code>/tardis setdest [name]</code> when you are in a TARDIS</li>
            <li>You can no longer use any travel commands if you are the NOT the timelord of the TARDIS you are currently inside</li>
            <li>The Police Box platform gets properly destroyed (if present) when using the <code>/tardis direction</code> command</li>
            <li>The chunks that Police Boxes are in are now kept loaded &mdash; this is to prevent the Police Box from not being destroyed properly when time travelling. Once the Police Box is moved the chunks are allowed to unload normally again. You can check which chunks are kept loaded with the command <code>/tardisadmin chunks</code></li>
            <li>Police Box chunks are now saved to a text file (chunks.txt) when the plugin is disabled, and reloaded again when the plugin is next enabled</li>
            <li>Safe location finding has been improved, there should always be at least one clear block in front of the door</li>
            <li>TARDIS areas set up in the Nether now work correctly. Note this will only be in effect for newly created areas. The plugin now also checks that the area start and end blocks are at the same Y level</li>
            <li>If a TARDIS was created in its own world, then the plugin no longer bothers to destroy the actual TARDIS as the world is deleted anyway</li>
            <li>General code tidying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed bug with the <code>/tardisadmin list</code> command</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the <code>/tardisadmin config</code> command</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis unbind [save_name]</code> command to remove a destination that has been bound to a button with the <code>/tardis bind</code> command</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where rooms grew funny (with missing blocks) if you left the TARDIS world while it was growing. The plugin now keeps the chunks the room is growing in loaded until the process is complete</li>
            <li>Added a new room &mdash; workshop, seed block is <code>NETHER_BRICK</code></li>
            <li>Added a new TARDIS interior &mdash; use an <code>EMERALD_BLOCK</code></li>
            <li>Made TARDIS worlds not have any weather (if using Multiverse) + a couple of other MV options (Don&rsquo;t keep TARDIS world spawn in memory, don&rsquo;t allow portals in TARDIS worlds)</li>
            <li>You can now exit the TARDIS to your current location if you have chosen a new destination but haven&rsquo;t released the handbrake yet.</li>
            <li>Removed some unused config options (<code>protect_blocks</code> and <code>require_spout</code>)</li>
            <li>Fixed an error if the TARDIS schematic doesn&rsquo;t have the correct block in it for the charged creeper to spawn on.</li>
            <li>Fixed the TARDIS Police Box sometimes melting when it is materialising (whose idea was it to put a torch next to ICE blocks anyway?)</li>
            <li>Admins can now allow players to grow rooms in non-TARDIS worlds &mdash; however, the world must be called <strong>TARDIS_TimeVortex</strong>, and either be world type <code>FLAT</code> or use the TARDISChunkGenerator, and of course the player must have the permission <code>tardis.room</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-3b</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Schematics have been updated, please delete the old ones and let them regenerate!</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the plugin disabling <code>create_worlds</code> even if Multiverse was installed on the server</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the Police Box sign appearing empty when <code>name_tardis</code> was true</li>
            <li>Fixed bug where some new database fields were not being created when upgrading from beta-2</li>
            <li>Please use the TARDISChunkGenerator included in the ZIP file :)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an Artron energy condenser &mdash; a chest that converts raw materials (DIRT, SAND, GRAVEL, COBBLESTONE and ROTTEN FLESH &mdash; May change to something rarer in final release!) to Artron energy &mdash; use the <code>/tardis update condenser</code> command after placing a chest.</li>
            <li>Added a new room type &mdash; a gravity well &mdash; this will let you make the TARDIS interior even bigger by providing a second level &mdash; use <code>/tardis room gravity</code> to build one &mdash; start with an empty room and place the seed block in the middle of the floor.</li>
            <li>Added a handbrake to the TARDIS console. This is what now initiates entry into the time vortex for all time travel operations.</li>
            <li>Fixed a Police Box duplication bug</li>
            <li>If no multi-world plugin (either Mulitverse or MultiWorld) is found, <code>create_worlds</code> is set to <code>false</code> in the config.</li>
            <li>Changed the random location method so that it returns a broader range of negative to positive values.</li>
            <li>Fixed TARDIS worlds not continuing to use the TARDISChunkGenerator</li>
            <li>Added no mob flags to Multiverse and MultiWorld configs for TARDIS worlds, so we don&rsquo;t have to rely on WorldGuard being on the server.</li>
            <li>Fixed a config error when excluding the TARDIS world as a time travel destination at creation time</li>
            <li>Fixed some wrong names in the config</li>
            <li>Made a TARDIS&rsquo; recharge status persistent over server restarts.</li>
            <li>Fixed the lightning listener throwing errors. Only allow natural lightning to charge the TARDIS if it not at a charging beacon.</li>
            <li>Now using prepared statements for all SQL queries so that we can handle world names with apostrophes in them.</li>
            <li>Renamed save-repeater to world-repeater (fixes <code>/tardis update save-repeater</code> which was broken)</li>
            <li>Saved destinations are now removed from the database when the TARDIS is deleted.</li>
            <li>Now bundled with the TARDISChunkGenerator in one ZIP file.</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Made the Artron energy <code>full_recharge_item</code> configurable</li>
            <li>TARDIS worlds are now NORMAL worlds (instead of THE_END), but are kept in perpetual night</li>
            <li>Fixed a couple of missing wool blocks in the &lsquo;Budget&rsquo; sized TARDIS</li>
            <li>The beacon base blocks in the TARDIS can no longer be broken and harvested</li>
            <li>If <code>create_worlds</code> is <code>false</code> in the config, players now get more Artron energy while time travelling, and can transfer it at anytime to the Artron Energy capacitor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-1</h3>
        <p>WARNING &mdash; not yet suitable for public servers! Please wait for a stable release.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now have the plugin generate separate worlds for each TARDIS</li>
            <li>TARDISes now consume Artron Energy, and need to be recharged periodically. Artron energy is used to time travel, hide the TARDIS and grow rooms. Recharging occurs when the TARDIS is in the vicinity of beacon blocks that have been defined as recharge points by the server admin. Each TARDIS now contains an Artron Energy Capacitor which needs to be initialised when the TARDIS is first created.</li>
            <li>You can now grow rooms off the TARDIS console room. Room types include: passage ways, an arboretum, bedrooms, kitchens, libraries, pools, vaults and empty rooms. Rooms can be jettisoned to gain more power.</li>
            <li>Travel to the Nether and The End now requires a (configurable) minimum amount of Artron energy so that it is harder to travel there (like vanilla Minecraft, and also like in the Doctor Who episode &lsquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Wife&rsquo;).</li>
            <li>The TARDIS Police Box can be configured to materialise when re-entering a world after travelling in the time vortex.</li>
            <li>If the Towny plugin is installed on the server, the TARDIS can be configured to only land in wilderness.</li>
            <li>Added an in-built update checker (you can turn this off in the config).</li>
            <li>Now backwards compatible to at least Bukkit 1.2.4-R4.1, so now working with Tekkit server again! (And yes, you can use the Sonic Screwdriver as the TARDIS key).</li>
            <li>Database handling completely rewritten.</li>
            <li>Classes split into packages.</li>
            <li>Various code optimisations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>v1.9.3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The plugin now actually uses the chameleon config option. If <code>chameleon</code> is set to <code>false</code> all Police Boxes will be blue wool.</li>
            <li>Changed the event priority when checking if the Police Box blocks are being damaged</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardis comehere</code> command now checks the location to make sure it is not griefing existing blocks</li>
            <li>When teleporting to a SURVIVAL world flying is disabled (if using Multiverse or MultiWorld plugins)</li>
            <li>Removed some old fire/ignite prevention methods in favour of WorldGuard protection</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed random location finding. When <code>land_on_water</code> is set to <code>false</code> you now no longer land on water!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added back some default config options that had gone AWOL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First combined release by eccentric_nz and ewized :)</li>
            <li>Fixed chest removal when removing/deleting a TARDIS</li>
            <li>Added config option &mdash; <code>name_tardis: [true|false]</code> sets whether to add the player&rsquo;s name to the TARDIS Police Box sign</li>
            <li>When using the <code>/tardis update button</code> command (or replacing the button in its original position), the TARDIS console &lsquo;button&rsquo; can now be a stone button, a wooden button or a lever</li>
            <li>Added command <code>/tardis version</code> to display the version of TARDIS and CraftBukkit the server is running</li>
            <li>Updated Materials list to add latest 1.4.6 items</li>
            <li>Added co-ordinates to random location message</li>

            <li>Police Box no longer drops a redstone torch when it is removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.8.7</h3>
        <ul>

        <h3>v1.8</h3>
        <p>Thanks to everyone who made suggestions or found bugs :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel is now possible to all three world environments &mdash; Overworld, Nether and The End. Overworld time travel is always available, but Nether and The End travel can be disabled in the config.</li>
            <li>There is now no longer a &lsquo;Save&rsquo; repeater on the TARDIS console &mdash; this has been replaced with an &lsquo;Environment&rsquo; selector.</li>
            <li>The 1-tick position will select a world with a random environment</li>
            <li>The 2-tick position will only select (Normal) Overworlds</li>
            <li>The 3-tick position will select from Nether worlds</li>
            <li>The 4-tick position will select The End worlds</li>
            <li>Due to there being no &lsquo;save&rsquo; repeater server administrators should run the command <code>/tardisadmin updatesaves</code> to convert any console saves into &lsquo;destinations&rsquo; (the same as those created by the /tardis setdest command.</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardis save</code> command has changed slightly as you no longer need to specify a slot number. Unlimited TARDIS destinations can now be saved using just: <code>/tardis save [mycoolsavename]</code></li>
            <li>A new sign can be added to the TARDIS interior &mdash; this is a &lsquo;save&rsquo; sign. First place a sign, then use the <code>/tardis update save-sign</code> command to initiate it.
                <ul>
                    <li>Right-clicking the sign will cycle through the TARDIS&rsquo;s saved destinations, as well as the TARDIS &lsquo;Home&rsquo;.</li>
                    <li>Right-clicking the sign while sneaking will set the TARDIS destination to the save currently shown on the sign.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardis removesave [savename]</code></li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardistravel home</code></li>
            <li>The Police Box can no longer be set on fire</li>
            <li>You can now stop the TARDIS landing on water with the config option <code>land_on_water: [true|false]</code></li>
            <li>You can now change the blocks that the TARDIS interior is constructed with.</li>
            <li>The material that gets used (replacing the orange wool) is determined by the middle block used when creating the TARDIS</li>
            <li>Not all materials are available, valid ones are: <code>LAPIS_BLOCK, STONE, DIRT, WOOD, SANDSTONE, WOOL, BRICK, NETHERRACK, SOUL_SAND, SMOOTH_BRICK, ENDER_STONE</code> and one other secret one!</li>
            <li>Data values are supported, so all wool colours, wood types etc are good to go</li>
            <li><code>LAPIS_BLOCK</code> will NOT give you a LAPIS interior, but the default orange wool</li>
            <li>Added extra WorldGuard flags so that TARDIS owners have access to chests and building (if not op)</li>
            <li>Added extra WorldGuard flags so that bats don&rsquo;t spawn in, and mobs can&rsquo;t damage the TARDIS</li>
            <li>Clearing the WorldGuard region when TARDIS is destroyed (had written the method, but forgot to call it!)</li>
            <li>Fixed (hopefully) the ghost/duplicate Police Box bug</li>
            <li>Actually optimised some code as well as adding new stuff :)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed errors when no arguments are supplied to the <code>/tardisprefs</code> and <code>/tardisarea</code> commands</li>
            <li>The block under the Police Box door is now a protected block</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed the WorldGuard soft-dependency issue, the plugin will no longer throw a wobbly when WorldGuard is not installed.</li>
            <li>Really, really fixed safe location finding this time</li>
            <li>Made it so you can only rename the TARDIS key item (as determined by the TARDIS config)</li>
            <li>Added config options to enable/disable WorldGuard &mdash; for inner TARDIS protection and for respecting WorldGuard regions created with another plugin &mdash; <code>use_worldguard: [true|false]</code> and <code>respect_worldguard: [true|false]</code></li>
            <li>Separated <code>/tardis</code> command into 5 separate commands:</li>
            <li><code>/tardis</code> &mdash; do stuff with your TARDIS</li>
            <li><code>/tardistravel</code> &mdash; go somewhere in your TARDIS</li>
            <li><code>/tardisprefs</code> &mdash; change your TARDIS preferences</li>
            <li><code>/tardisadmin</code> &mdash; change the TARDIS plugin configuration</li>
            <li><code>/tardisarea</code> &mdash; Set up predefined TARDIS travel areas</li>
            <li>As you can see the commands haven&rsquo;t really changed all that much, instead of <code>/command [argument]</code>, some commands are now <code>/commandargument</code>, the rest of the required arguments to the commands have not changed. Check the Commands page for the updated syntax</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed <code>/tardis comehere</code> command leaving a &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; police box behind (I think)</li>
            <li>Added command to rename the TARDIS key item &mdash; hold the key in your hand and type <code>/tardis namekey [your cool name here]</code></li>
            <li>Added &lsquo;Sonic Screwdriver&rsquo; name to TARDIS key item if it is automatically added to players inventory on time travel to a different world</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed <code>/tardis admin area start [area_name_goes_here]</code> throwing an error if you forgot to give it a name</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the WorldGuard plugin is installed on the server, inner TARDISs are now protected with a WorldGuard Cuboid region that is owned by the player who created it. WorldGuard protection flags include: TNT, CREEPER<em>EXPLOSION, FIRE</em>SPREAD, LAVA<em>FIRE, LAVA</em>FLOW, LIGHTER, and BUILD, all set to DENY &mdash; NOTE Protection applies only to TARDISs created with this version of the plugin, AND will not extend to custom TARDIS extensions!</li>
            <li>Fixed Police Box sign not being protected after using the /tardis direction command</li>
            <li>Improved/fixed travel to The End &mdash; previously safe location finding would potentially send the the plugin into an endless loop and hang the server, if repeater travel distance settings were too high (The End is not very big!)</li>
            <li>Improved safe location finding &mdash; when the Police Box is facing in an EAST or WEST direction the rectangular safe search area is now oriented correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The TARDIS Police Box is now protected form TNT &amp; Creeper explosions plus Wither &amp; Ender Dragon damage</li>
            <li>Added ability to travel to The End, (End worlds will be loaded into the config) but time travel to The End is disabled by default &mdash; edit the config and make <code>the_end: true</code> to enable</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed not being able to remove a companion when there is only one in the list</li>

        <h3>v1.7.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Never got uploaded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Compatible with latest CraftBukkit 1.4.2R0.2-SNAPSHOT</li>
            <li>Updated materials list to reflect new MC 1.4.2 additions</li>
            <li>Fixed the TARDIS &lsquo;griefing&rsquo; &mdash; blocks displaced by the police box are now replaced when the TARDIS leaves</li>
            <li>Check worlds in config are still active on the server when plugin starts up, remove from config if not (hopefully fixes random location finding not working for some players)</li>
            <li>Added command to save additional TARDIS destinations &mdash; look at destination block and use <code>/tardis setdest [name]</code></li>
            <li>Changed <code>/tardis list saves</code> command so that it lists all saved destinations (not just those saved in the TARDIS console)</li>
            <li>Added TARDIS &lsquo;areas&rsquo; &mdash; you can now set rectangular regions that you can either exclude players from landing in, or only allow certain players to land in. See the Areas page for more details on setting these up.</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis list areas</code> command to show preset areas</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis travel dest [name]</code> and <code>/tardis travel area [name]</code> commands</li>
            <li>Changed the default TARDIS key to a STICK as REDSTONE<em>TORCH</em>ON is a bit buggy when it comes to clicking on the top half of iron doors. The key can still set to any material in the TARDIS config (I use a GOLDEN_CARROT!)</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis home command</code> &mdash; saves the block location you are looking at to the &lsquo;home&rsquo; slot on the TARDIS console save-repeater.</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis hide command</code> &mdash; hides the TARDIS police box, use <code>/tardis rebuild</code> to show it again.</li>
            <li>Added permission node tardis.skeletonkey &mdash; allows admins/ops with this permission to enter any TARDIS</li>
            <li>Changed all permission nodes to be lowercase</li>
            <li>Added config option to give the TARDIS key to players when time travelling to a different world (and a multi-world inventory plugin is active on the server). Add give_key: true to the TARDIS config.yml to enable it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added different sized TARDIS interiors &mdash; The bottom block when creating a TARDIS determines the size &mdash; IRON block gives the current TARDIS, GOLD block gives a bigger TARDIS, DIAMOND block gives a deluxe TARDIS. Deluxe TARDIS schematic kindly provided by ewized.</li>
            <li>You can now use your own schematic files to build the inner TARDIS &mdash; see the <a href="schematis.html">Schematics</a> page for more info&hellip;</li>
            <li>A fix for the &lsquo;chameleon circuit exploit&rsquo; &mdash; the Police Box is now indestructible in SURVIVAL mode (except for the sign &amp; platform if there is one).</li>
            <li>Random location finding and <code>/tardis comehere</code> command now respects WorldGuard regions (if WorldGuard is enabled on server).</li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardis direction [north </code>
                </td>
                <td><code>west</code></td>
                <td><code>south</code></td>
                <td><code>east]</code> allows you to change the direction the TARDIS police box is facing. 
            </li>
            <li>Exit and entry locations fixed, should not take any damage now.</li>

            <li>Removed &lsquo;Have not created TARDIS&rsquo; message when clicking on an iron door.</li>
            <li>This version will no longer allow you to update from a version 1.2.3 and below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.5.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added Remote Control! You can now make your TARDIS come to the spot you are looking at with the command <code>/tardis comehere</code></li>
            <li>Added player preferences for turning Who quotes on and off <code>/tardis quotes [on </code>
                </td>
                <td><code>off] </code>
            </li>
            <li>Added admin command to view current config settings <code>/tardis admin config</code></li>
            <li>Improvements to Chameleon Circuit &mdash; shouldn&rsquo;t be any AIR TARDISs anymore, also if a valid blending block can&rsquo;t be found directly beneath the TARDIS, it now checks the surrounding blocks</li>
