		</ul>
		<h4>Changes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When using the <code>full_charge_item</code>, if the current Artron levels exceed a full charge, TARDIS no longer <em>reduces</em> an overcharged capacitor to a full charge and does&rsquo;t remove the <code>full_charge_item</code> from the player.</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a Zero room, the feature is disabled by default, use the <code>/tadmin zero_room true</code> command to enable it and create the TARDIS<em>Zero</em>Room world if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. <a href="http://eccentricdevotion.github.io/TARDIS/zero-room.html">http://eccentricdevotion.github.io/TARDIS/zero-room.html</a>
				<ul>
					<li>a restart is required to enable chat isolation and healing</li>
					<li>use <code>/tardis room zero</code> to add the room (it&rsquo;s not compatible with ARS, as it is located in its own universe)</li>
					<li>players can use <code>/tardis update zero</code> to add transmat button to move between the TARDIS and the Zero room</li>
					<li>you can&rsquo;t break blocks or use chat / commands in the zero room</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added custom rooms to ARS if they are 16 x 16, we make no guarantees that they will work like the default rooms though!
				<ul>
					<li>Use the template.schematic (in the <em>plugins/TARDIS/schematics</em> folder) when building custom rooms to ensure compatibility</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a TARDIS Universal Translator &mdash; <code>/tardissay [language] [message]</code>, the <code>[message]</code> defaults to AUTO_DETECT unless <code>/tardisprefs language [language]</code> is used
				<ul>

					<li>limited to 2,000,000 characters per month, who knows what happens after that!</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Right-click the Direction Frame to change the TARDIS direction</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Changes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented hard difficulty level to the <code>/tardistravel</code> and <code>/tardis save</code> commands
				<ul>
					<li>players need to use the Advanced Console and disks instead of the travel command</li>
					<li>players need to be holding a blank save disk in hand when using the save command</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Both doors are toggled open when shift-clicking either door (most of the time, it can be a bit buggy). When exiting &mdash; if the preset has a door and the door is open &mdash; the player is teleported to the door location (instead of right outside the Police Box).</li>
			<li>The door must be closed to time travel</li>
			<li>Now using the correct Artron Energy values for the type of travel, instead of the &lsquo;random&rsquo; value everytime</li>
			<li>If a world is disabled in config, TARDIS creation is no longer allowed in that world</li>
			<li>We&rsquo;re now respecting the <code>tardis.save</code> permission in the Advanced Console and for <code>/tardistravel dest [save]</code> command</li>
			<li>We&rsquo;re now respecting the <code>tardis.sonic.standard</code> permission for standard sonic functions</li>
			<li>To list TARDISes to prune you now need to use the <code>/tardisadmin prunelist</code> command</li>
			<li>If the current TARDIS location can&rsquo;t be found in the database (maybe because a world has been deleted), then the plugin performs an Emergency Relocation</li>
			<li>The plugin now checks there is sufficient energy to use the Exterior Rendering Room</li>
			<li>The plugin now checks the player has sufficient Artron Energy when using the save sign</li>
			<li>If ProtocolLib is enabled on the server, you can now just click the keyboard sign to edit it (rather than having to click it with another sign)</li>
			<li>The plugin is now stricter with the use of the <code>/tardis occupy</code> command &mdash; it only sets occupied if the player is IN the TARDIS or UNoccupied if outside</li>
			<li>Altered the Bukkit version checker so that the plugin will enable on MCPC+ servers</li>
			<li>The plugin now checks the player has permission to break the block with the Diamond Sonic Screwdriver</li>
			<li>The plugin now only equips the perception filter if the chest plate slot is empty</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

			<li>Added Exterior Rendering Room preference &mdash; <code>/tardisprefs renderer [on|off]</code></li>
			<li>Added relative coordinates travel &mdash; same permission as normal coordinates travel &mdash; similar to normal coordinates travel, but you don&rsquo;t need to specify a world, and the relative values MUST be proceeded by a tilde (<code>~</code>) e.g. <code>/tardistravel ~50 ~ ~90</code> moves you 50 blocks in the X direction, 0 blocks in the Y direction and 90 blocks in the Z direction</li>
			<li>Added the ability for the Sonic Screwdriver to sort chests &mdash; permission <code>tardis.sonic.sort</code></li>

		<h3 id="v26b3">v2.6-beta-3</h3>
		<p>What happened to <em>TARDIS v2.6-beta-2</em>, you might ask? It was rejected by Bukkit for having a non-compliant update checker. Perhaps an email advising developers of the change in policy would have been nice... but never mind here&rsquo;s beta 3 :)</p>

			<li>Added the ability to add a custom preset &mdash; edit the <em>plugins/TARDIS/custom_preset.txt</em> file and restart the server. The file contains data for the new taller Police Box preset &mdash; you should be able to work it out from there (the sign <em>if used</em>, will need to be in the default location).</li>
			<li>Added a new setting to the Chameleon Circuit GUI &mdash; Biome Adaption &mdash; if this is turned on, a biome related preset will be selected automatically (if there is one)</li>
			<li>Added a command to remove the ARS sign to allow manual room growing in the ARS grid area <code>/tardis arsremove</code> &mdash; useful if your TARDIS was created before v2.6 and is not compatible with ARS (Note: adding it back after removal will potentially overwrite any manually grown rooms)</li>
			<li>Added tab auto-completion for player names added to the <code>/tardisadmin enter</code> and <code>/tardisadmin delete</code> commands</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Changes</h4>
		<ul>

			<li>All schematics updated with new piston doors &mdash; they now only open if there is a room on the other side &mdash; once again thanks to Lord_Rahl and killeratnight</li>
			<li>Some presets now have random attributes &mdash; for example the Party Tent and Flower change to a random colour, the Angel has different wing and head positions</li>
			<li>The Chameleon Circuit GUI no longer closes when you select a preset &mdash; you need to use the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; or &lsquo;Apply&rsquo; button (or just hit ESC on the keyboard)</li>
			<li>The SWAMP preset has changed to be more like a witches hut</li>
			<li>The TARDIS &lsquo;last use&rsquo; field is set upon TARDIS creation, and updated more often (not just when a Time Lord travels)</li>
			<li>The random destination button now selects a random location relative to the current location of the TARDIS preset (when travelling in the <em>same</em> world)</li>
			<li>The <code>/tardistravel biome [biome]</code> command now finds the closest biome relative to the current location of the TARDIS preset (and not the player&rsquo;s location)</li>
			<li>Removed bonus_chest from config, admin commands and builder</li>
			<li>Removed the update checker &mdash; plugin enabling should be quicker now anyway</li>
			<li>Light grey wool blocks (usually the floor blocks) in TARDIS consoles (except the EMERALD type) are now replaced with the player&rsquo;s preferred floor block (like rooms already do)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

			<li>Fixed doors, trapdoors and various other blocks popping off presets when they de/materialise</li>
			<li>Fixed under door and platform blocks not being removed when the TARDIS leaves a location</li>
			<li>Fixed DROPPERS getting the wrong data value when being grown in a room</li>
			<li>Fixed a conflict with the JSONArray class</li>
			<li>Fixed pets disappearing when the player tries to exit the TARDIS with them</li>
			<li>In the ARS GUI, both (anti)gravity well slots are reset when jettisoning said rooms</li>
			<li>Fixed a parse number error trying to update <em>lastuse</em> for players with <code>tardis.prune.bybass</code> perms</li>
			<li>Fixed the platform and underdoor blocks being left behind if they just replaced AIR</li>

					<li>This should allow servers to set a plain TARDIS as default (as seen in DW Series 7 finale)</li>
					<li>If you don &rsquo;t care, just leave the settings at the defaults to have the plugin behave as it usually does</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a RAIL room
				<ul>
					<li>After growing the room, run rails up to the Police Box door to have minecarts transported into the TARDIS</li>
					<li>Only one minecart is allowed through at a time</li>
					<li>Storage minecarts will deposit their contents into a chest via a hopper</li>
					<li>What else you do with them once they &rsquo;re there is up to you</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a switch to turn the lights in the main console room on and off
				<ul>
					<li>Use the <code>/tardis update light</code> command to add it</li>
					<li>If you have moved any lamp blocks, use the <code>/tardis lamps</code> command to rescan the TARDIS for their new locations</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a new command &mdash; <code>tardisrecipe [item]</code> to show custom recipes for the new TARDIS items (see below)</li>
			<li>Added a new config option &mdash; <code>difficulty: [easy|normal|hard]</code> &mdash; default is <code>normal</code>, for why see below</li>
			<li>Added a craftable Stattenheim Remote Control
				<ul>
					<li>To see the recipe type <code>/tardisrecipe remote</code></li>
					<li>This item replaces the <code>/tardis comehere</code> command when <code>difficulty</code> is set to normal or hard</li>
					<li>The item is harder to craft when <code>difficulty</code> is set to hard</li>
					<li>Right-click the block you want the TARDIS to come to</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added  a craftable TARDIS Locator
				<ul>
					<li>To see the recipe type <code>/tardisrecipe locator</code></li>
					<li>This item replaces the <code>/tardis find</code> command when <code>difficulty</code>is set to normal or hard</li>
					<li>The item is crafted with another custom item the TARDIS Locator Circuit, see below</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added 3 craftable TARDIS circuits &mdash; Locator Circuit, Materialisation Circuit and Stattenheim Circuit
				<ul>
					<li>The items are custom maps &mdash; three maps are supplied with in the ZIP download &mdash; put them in the main server world &rsquo;s //data// folder to use them (maps will probably change for final 2.5 release)</li>
					<li>To see the recipes type <code>/tardisrecipe [l-circuit|m-circuit|s-circuit]</code></li>
					<li>The Locator Circuit and Materialisation Circuit are required to craft the Stattenheim Circuit when <code>difficulty</code> is set to hard</li>
					<li>The Stattenheim Circuit is required to craft the Stattenheim Remote when <code>difficulty</code> is set to hard</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added a config option <code>use_clay: [true|false]</code> &mdash; if true it will switch the WOOL blocks in TARDIS and room schematics to the equivalent coloured STAINED _CLAY blocks (for new TARDIS and rooms only)</li>
			<li>Added the start of an Architectural Reconfiguration System, another sign with an inventory based GUI
				<ul>
					<li>Use the <code>/tardis update ars</code> command to add it</li>
					<li>See: <a href="https://vimeo.com/68938409">https://vimeo.com/68938409</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Changes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The Emergency Program One NPC should now face the centre of the TARDIS and look at players</li>
			<li>Comparator blocks can now be TARDIS console buttons</li>
			<li>TARDIS now tells MultiWorld to delete the TARDIS world after the TARDIS has been deleted</li>
			<li>The save-sign has been updated to a new inventory based GUI, all your saves are listed in one place
				<ul>
					<li>Just click a save to set it as the destination</li>
					<li>To update the old save sign, just run the <code>/tardis update save-sign</code> command again</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You can now condense pistons, redstone torches and trapdoors</li>
			<li>Rooms are now jettisoned from the top down</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Fixes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The texture pack switch no longer switches when entering by the backdoor and texture pack switching is off</li>
			<li>The pet teleport location has been fixed when pets exit the TARDIS</li>
			<li>Fixed the rescue accept message saying you had 30 seconds, when really you had 60</li>
			<li>Rooms are only processed if they are enabled and square (fixes a NPE)</li>
			<li>The data values for directional blocks are set correctly for rooms grown in a NORTH or WEST direction</li>
			<li>The NPC Listener is only registered if the Citizens plugin is enabled</li>
			<li>Players are now always removed from the time traveller list before being added, this prevents the player being added more than once (if they exit the TARDIS by some other means than by the door) and receiving multiple messages when the handbrake is released</li>
			<li>Fixed a NPE when trying to remove the last (or only) companion</li>
			<li>You can no longer travel to yourself with the <code>/tardistravel [player]</code> command</li>
			<li>This version is now compatible with Tekkit Classic (or any CraftBukkit 1.2.5 server) again</li>
