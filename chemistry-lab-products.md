## Lamps

Lamps are simple light source blocks.

-   You can craft 4 different colors of Lamps: blue, red, purple, and green lamps.
-   Each lamp produces a light level of 15, the highest light level possible.
-   If the block is updated (e.g. a block is placed next to it) it loses its light until it is placed again.
-   Breaking the block does not give the item back.
-   The Lamp can be toggled with a Redstone-enabled [Sonic Screwdriver](sonic-screwdriver)
