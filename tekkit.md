# Tekkit

The TARDIS plugin is compatible with Tekkit Classic, however there are a few changes that will need to made to provide for the fact that Tekkit only uses CraftBukkit 1.2.5.

Things that are different or you will need to change:

- There are no wooden buttons — replace these with stone ones
- There are no beacons — you will need to use a (powered) Redstone Lamp as your Artron Energy recharge points instead
- There are no Nether Stars — in the config, change the `full_charge_item` to another material
- You cannot rename the TARDIS key
- Some rooms may contain blocks (such as Flower Pots in the Arboretum) that are changed to something completely different
- You may need to change some of the room seed blocks, and/or disable the room entirely as they may contain blocks that don’t exist in Minecraft 1.2.5
- You **can** use the Sonic Screwdriver as the TARDIS key :)
