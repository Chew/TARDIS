# TODO

## Current version `2.6-beta-1`
1. Test `platform_id`, Temporal Invisibility
2. Jettison the whole room (including walls), will require new room schematics... (in progress - working with ARS :)
3. Architectural Reconfiguration System (almost there)
    * Doorways still. If a room is growing and there isn't one next to it - _but there will be_ - the doorway blocks will need to be removed. Could do a check right at the end, but it might just be easier to leave the doorway openâ€¦
4. Remove the TARDIS creation block stack, and make a special seed block that determines the type of TARDIS that will be grown. Use custom configurable recipes - the recipes will still include precious block/lapis block/redstone torch, but 4 other blocks will set:
    * TARDIS wall block
    * TARDIS floor block
    * Police Box wall block (chameleon)
    * Police Box lamp block
    * Seed blocks when broken, should drop themselves
5. While doing [4], add one slot for a custom console
6. HADS + explosions + fireballs + lava
7. Put farmland, crops, buttons, levers and signs on last when growing rooms
8. Sonic Screwdrivers
9. TARDIS Information System (in progress)
10. Chameleon presets (in progress)
    * Grass mound?
    * Allow wood doors to be exterior TARDIS doors

### Waiting on Bukkit API
2. Get/set horse speed (Attribute API)

## Next version `2.7+`
