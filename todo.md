# TODO
1. Add Equivalent Exchange style Energy condenser for converting unwanted blocks into Artron energy. MAybe 1 DIRT = 0.5 artron levels?
2. Add a gravity well to TARDIS rooms so that you can build up and down. Maybe similar to a Lift type plugin?
3. Add basic entity remover for TARDIS worlds if WorldGuard is not installed on the server (probably not needed if 2. below...)
4. Set `create_worlds: false` if no multi-world plugin is found.
5. Add cake block to TARDIS console in schematics as placeholder for handbrake (eat five slices to get data byte of 5?).
6. Check what happens when companions use the TARDIS with regards to:
   - Recharging
7. Update schematic dimensions so all rooms have their own dimensions
   - Still undecided whether we should allow/can actually let players use their own room schematics
8. Finish doing tutorial videos
9. TEST, TEST, TEST

#Minecraft API when available
1. Create custom blocks for the tardis box and console.
2. If using the lapis block have the walls a special tardis wall block.
3. A tardis key that is a Sonic Screwdriver, also a crafting for that item.
4. GUI (if allowed)
5. Sounds (if allowed)
6. Make the TARDIS an entity (if allowed)
