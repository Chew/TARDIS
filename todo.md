##Resource Pack / TARDISWeepingAngels

2. Re-skin mobs for Resource pack, and add new mob sounds

   * Villagers -> Ood - _started texture_
   * Villagers -> Hath
   * Endermen -> The Silence - _implemented, but texture needs to be finished_
   * Endermites -> Cybermats
   * Iron Golem -> Gunslinger
   * Witches -> Slitheen / Whispermen?
   * Wolves -> K-9? (All the textures I seen so far just don't work - you shouldn't see the legs...)
   * Slimes -> Adipose

##Waiting on Bukkit / SpigotAPI
0. IDs/data are soon to be history... so convert all ID/data use to block states 
1. Get/set horse speed (Attribute API)
2. Achievements API is now available, but doesn't allow custom achievements :( [https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-5672](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-5672)

##Minecraft API when available
1. Recreate everything with the new API :)
2. Create custom blocks for the TARDIS and console.
3. Custom TARDIS items and crafting recipes for the same.
4. A Sonic Screwdriver and a crafting recipe for it.
5. GUIs (if allowed)
6. Make the TARDIS Police Box an entity (if allowed)
7. Custom achievements
8. Custom monsters
