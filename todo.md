# TODO
 
## Current version `2.2-release`
1. Add video for books/achievements

## Next version `2.3-beta-1`
1. Check what happens when companions steal the TARDIS
2. Check repeater order on console
2. Test the `/tardis update` command
2. Add a `/tardis secondary` command
3. Add player pref to only have the beacon on while travelling

## Future version `2.4+`
1. Add an Emergency Program system. If a Time Lord dies, the autonomous circuit is on, and there are companions inside the TARDIS, then a fake "player" will spawn near the console and give a prerecorded "message" to the TARDIS occupants through chat. Add a preference setting for it, as well as making the message configurable by the player.

## Minecraft API when available `3.0?`
1. Recreate everything with the new API :)
2. Create custom blocks for the TARDIS and console.
3. If using the LAPIS block have the walls a special TARDIS wall block.
4. A TARDIS key and a crafting recipe for that item.
5. A Sonic Screwdriver and a crafting recipe for that item.
6. GUI (if allowed)
7. Sounds (if allowed)
8. Make the TARDIS Police Box an entity (if allowed)
