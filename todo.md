# TODO

##Current version `2.8`

These are all really boring!

####Stuff I'll get round to (but I'm not rushing to code):
1. Videos
3. Localisation
4. Configurable option to allow Gravity Wells outside of the TARDIS

####Stuff I don't really want to do, but probably will (eventually)
1. Toggle both doors open when shift-clicking the door, and when exiting (if the preset has a door and the door is open) tp the player to the door location.
2. Custom data classes for mat / demat
3. `/tardisadmin` remote TARDIS commands

####I couldn't really be bothered
1. TARDIS invisiblity
2. HADS + explosions + fireballs + lava
3. Put farmland, crops, buttons, ladders, levers and signs on last when growing rooms
4. TARDIS exterior rendering / scanner room
    * find a way to prevent items dropping between renders
5. TARDIS Information System
    * auto log out?
    
##Future version `2.9+`
* ?
