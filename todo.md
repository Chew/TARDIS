# TODO

##Current version `2.8`
1. Convert player persistence to UUIDs - TARDIS code is done, waiting on plugin dependencies to update (WorldGuard etc...)

These are all really boring!

####Stuff I'll get round to (but I'm not rushing to code):
1. Videos
2. Localisation
3. `/tardisadmin` remote TARDIS commands

##Future version `2.9+`
1. UHC flying mode (started - have coded some test plugins)
2. TARDIS invisiblity - 1.8 barrier blocks?

####I couldn't really be bothered
1. HADS + explosions + fireballs + lava
2. Put farmland, crops, buttons, ladders, levers and signs on last when growing rooms
3. TARDIS Information System
    * auto log out?

Reskin mobs for Resource pack, and add new mob sounds

* Skeletons -> Weeping Angels - __done__
* Wither Skeletons -> Vashta Nerada

* Endermen -> The Silence

##Waiting on Bukkit API
0. IDs are soon to be history... so convert all ID use to entity names
1. Get/set horse speed (Attribute API)
2. Achievements API is now available, but doesn't allow custom achievements :(

# Minecraft API when available
1. Recreate everything with the new API :)
2. Create custom blocks for the TARDIS and console.
3. If using the LAPIS block have the walls a special TARDIS wall block.
4. Custom TARDIS items and crafting recipes for the same.
5. A Sonic Screwdriver and a crafting recipe for it.
6. GUIs (if allowed)
7. Make the TARDIS Police Box an entity (if allowed)
8. Custom achievements
9. Custom monsters
