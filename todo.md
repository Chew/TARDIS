#TODO

##Current version `3.0-beta-2`
1. Find & fix bugs

##Future version `3.1+`
1. TARDIS up/cross-grades (change the desktop theme)
2. Saved biome disks able to be extended
3. Update the VAULT room to automatically sort items into the chests
   * one chest is set as the drop chest
   * all other chests in the 16x16x16 chunk are set as storage chests
   * place at least 1 block/item into the storage chests
   * blocks/items placed in the drop chest will automatically be sent to the chest with the same block/item in it
   * add commands to update existing VAULT rooms to the new system
4. Slimmer TARDIS option?

##Resource Pack / TARDISWeepingAngels

Re-skin mobs for Resource pack, and add new mob sounds

* Villagers -> Ood - _started_
* Villagers -> Hath
* Endermen -> The Silence
* Iron Golem -> Gunslinger
* Witches -> Slitheen?
* Wolves -> K-9? (All the textures I seen so far just don't work - you shouldn't see the legs...)
* Slimes -> Adipose

##Waiting on Minecraft/Bukkit update

1. TARDIS invisibility - 1.8 barrier blocks?
