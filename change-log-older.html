                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The TARDIS now automatically powers down if it runs out of energy</li>
            <li>To power up or down the TARDIS players must must have the TARDIS key in hand</li>
            <li>Reverted back to the old behaviour of clicking Artron button with NO key in hand to show the current power level</li>
            <li>Added snowy biomes to <code>set_biome</code> umbrella</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>Fixed the Genetic Manipulator not working even though the power was on</li>
            <li>Power is not removed in standby mode if the TARDIS is at a recharge point</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>v2.9-beta-2</h3>
        <p>The TARDIS resource packs have also been updated, get them here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-MCP">TARDIS-MCP resource pack</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack">TARDIS-Sounds resource pack</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an &lsquo;umbrella&rsquo; to the police box when <code>set_biome</code> is true and the TARDIS lands in a dry biome.</li>
            <li>All in-game messages can  now be localised to the server&rsquo;s preferred language
                <ul>
                    <li>the default language is English, and all the messages are contained in the <code>plugins/TARDIS/language/en.yml</code> file</li>
                    <li>config option: <code>preferences.language: [language code]</code> &mdash; set the language with the command: <code>/tardisadmin language [code]</code> &mdash; use tab completion to see a list of codes</li>
                    <li>language translations require their own file. Make a copy of <code>en.yml</code> and translate it. For example; if the language is set to Spanish (code: <strong>es</strong>), then a file called <code>es.yml</code> needs to placed in the <code>plugins/TARDIS/language/</code> folder</li>
                    <li>Vistaero (a helpful TARDIS plugin user) has written a useful tool for editing language files, you can get it here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/35rx51ly8994vux/Language%20File%20Translator.zip">TARDIS Language File Translator</a> and a tutorial video is here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxuamw6s2733g8e/Demo.mp4">Language File Translator Demo</a></li>
                    <li>as messages are added for new TARDIS features, the preferred language file will be updated (in English) for you to translate</li>
                    <li>See it in action on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_i66YKIgQ">Youtube</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can now completely power down the TARDIS
                <ul>
                    <li>after the Artron Capacitor has been initialised, right-clicking the Artron button turns the power on and off</li>
                    <li>when powered down access is denied to any TARDIS features that require power</li>
                    <li>if the TARDIS is hidden it will become visible again due to power loss</li>
                    <li>if the TARDIS is left in standby mode (i.e. powered on but not doing anything), a small (configurable) amount of Artron energy is used every (configurable) cycle</li>
                    <li><strong>config options:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>in <em>config.yml</em> <code>allow.power_down: [true|false]</code> &mdash; let players power down the TARDIS</li>
                            <li>in <em>artron.yml</em> <code>standby: [amount]</code> &mdash; the amount of energy the TARDIS uses each cycle in standby mode</li>
                            <li>in <em>artron.yml</em> <code>standby_time: [ticks]</code> &mdash; the length of the repeating cycle in server ticks i.e. energy is removed every x ticks &mdash; if set to <code>0</code> then this feature is disabled</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>you cannot power down while travelling</li>
                    <li>there are new power up and power down sound effects (<a href="https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack">resource pack</a> required)</li>
                    <li>the exterior (redstone) lamp will turn off as well (if there is one)</li>
                    <li>the TARDIS will not power up if it has no power</li>
                    <li>the TARDIS will automatically power down on the next cycle after Artron levels reach zero</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3TNANYxoEQ" target="_blank">Video</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added a Key Prefs Menu to change to different TARDIS key types
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>requires</strong> the <a href="https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-MCP">TARDIS-MCP resource pack</a> (and MCPatcher)</li>
                    <li>works the same as the Sonic Prefs Menu</li>
                    <li>access the menu with the command <code>/tardisprefs key_menu</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added a travel time progress bar
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>requires</strong> the <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bar-api/">BarAPI</a> plugin</li>
                    <li>is a player preference &mdash; set it with <code>/tardisprefs travelbar [on|off]</code>, or use the Player Prefs Menu</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>TARDIS now prevents unwanted mobs spawning in TARDIS worlds itself, instead of relying on other plugins (WorldGuard, Multiverse etc)</li>
            <li>The plugin now only gives Artron energy to players if they have actually travelled (not every time they go through the door)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed the Sonic Prefs Menu not returning the player&rsquo;s sonic if they left it in the GUI and then closed it</li>
            <li>Fixed the Sonic Prefs Menu allowing items to be placed in bad slots</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in Manual Flight mode where if the player did nothing, TARDIS spammed the console with 1000s of errors</li>
            <li>The hinge is set properly for the interior TARDIS door when it is created (fixes missing texture file when using the TARDIS-MCP resource pack)</li>
            <li>Fixed a NullPointerException when trying to reset the biome after the Police Box has left, and added a biome database field updater so that it shouldn&rsquo;t ever happen again</li>
            <li>Fixed Genetic Manipulator room not showing in ARS GUI until the rooms had been scrolled</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.9-beta-1</h3>
        <p>As always, some big changes to TARDIS entry mechanics &mdash; please read carefully.</p>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a <code>/tardisremote</code> command
                <ul>
                    <li>permission <code>tardis.remote</code> default: op</li>
                    <li>actions currently supported: travel, comehere, chameleon, hide, rebuild, back</li>
                    <li>arguments: <code>/tardisremote [player] [action] [travel options]</code></li>
                    <li>if action = travel, <code>travel options</code> are: <code>home</code>, <code>area [area name]</code>, and coords e.g. <code>world x y z</code></li>
                    <li>can be run from command blocks, but the specified player must be online</li>
                    <li>if the player who is running the command does <strong>NOT</strong> have <code>tardis.admin</code> permission, then the normal checks are performed (energy/permissions/circuits/plugin respect etc for the specified player)</li>
                    <li>use via Command Block will fail silently if above checks fail, as we can&rsquo;t message a command block&hellip;</li>
                    <li>if player has <code>tardis.admin</code> permission then no energy is used / only basic checks performed (so we&rsquo;re not griefing anything)</li>
                    <li><code>comehere</code> comes to the currently targeted block (only available to TARDIS admin players)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VypqSYls1QM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VypqSYls1QM</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added the ability to walk in and out of the TARDIS if the door is open (instead of clicking the door) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyrJyzxmtz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyrJyzxmtz8</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>to use the new method, enable it with <code>/tardisadmin walk_in_tardis true</code> and restart the server</li>
                    <li>when enabled, RIGHT-clicking the door opens it, SHIFT_RIGHT-clicking teleports (the old behaviour)</li>
                    <li>Not all TARDIS presets support walking in!</li>
                    <li>The exterior door can be opened and entered by the Time lord of the TARDIS and any companion, but only the Time Lord can deadlock the door. The exterior door must be opened with the TARDIS key</li>
                    <li>Both doors can be closed using any item or empty hand</li>
                    <li>If you leave the door open (and the Police Box is visible), any monsters within a 16 block radius can enter the TARDIS (unless a player is also within range). If there are no monsters nearby outside there will be a 25% percent chance that a random monster will spawn inside the TARDIS. A check is made every 2 minutes the door is left open</li>
                    <li>Due to the fact that Endermen can enter the TARDIS, you may want to set <code>enderman-grief: deny</code> in your WorldGuard region config</li>
                    <li>Added a <code>/tardisadmin purge_portals</code> command to clear all data associated with walking into the TARDIS (they&rsquo;ll still work, just toggle open the door again)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added a &lsquo;black wool behind door&rsquo; toggle switch
                <ul>
                    <li>This allows access to the outside of the TARDIS (useful if you have built a nice view)</li>
                    <li><code>/tardis update toggle_wool</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added MCPatcher texture support and made a new <a href="https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-MCP">TARDIS Resource Pack</a> &mdash; <strong>Note:</strong> things may look a little odd until you rebuild the TARDIS
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/688-tardis-mcpatcher-texture-support/">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/688-tardis-mcpatcher-texture-support/</a></li>
                    <li>If using an MCPatcher modded client with the Connected Textures and Custom Item Textures mods installed the TARDIS uses biome specific textures for the Police Box and TARDIS interior, and custom textures for all TARDIS items</li>
                    <li>to make the Police Box use the custom textures you need to enable it in the config (it is on by default) &mdash; <code>/tardisadmin set_biome true</code></li>
                    <li>to make the TARDIS interior use the custom textures you need to enable it in the config (it is on by default) &mdash; <code>/tardisadmin sky_biome true</code></li>
                    <li>the Police Box 3x3 block area is set to DEEP_OCEAN biome, the TARDIS interior is set to SKY biome</li>
                    <li>only new interiors and rooms are set, to change existing consoles and rooms, you will need to use the WorldEdit <code>//setbiome</code> command</li>

                    <li>Added a <code>/tardisprefs ctm [on|off]</code> command &mdash; if <code>on</code> the plugin replaces the left front wool block in the Police box with a
                        quartz pillar textured on ends with the TARDIS door sign</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>if <code>all_blocks</code> is set to <code>false</code> in the main config, the key can only be set to the items in the keys list</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Added TARDIS flight modes
                <ul>
                    <li>use the <code>/tardisprefs flight [mode]</code> command to set the flight mode</li>
                    <li>modes are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>normal</code> &mdash; the default, what we&rsquo;re all currently used to</li>
                            <li><code>regulator</code> &mdash; use the Helmic Regulator to correct the TARDIS&rsquo; flight path, a GUI will open automatically &mdash; use the direction blocks to keep the regulator in the centre</li>
                            <li><code>manual</code> &mdash; run round like crazy clicking the correct console repeater when told to do so</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In manual flight mode the repeaters are called:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>world</code>: Helmic Regulator</li>

                    <li>in manual flight mode you can set the delay between having to click the repeaters in the config: <code>/tardisadmin manual_flight_delay [ticks]</code> &mdash; default is 60 (3 seconds)</li>
                    <li>in regulator flight mode, the further away from the centre the regulator block is, the further from your desired location you will land</li>
                    <li>in manual flight mode, the more repeaters you miss hitting, the further from your desired location you will land</li>
                    <li>currently if the destination is inside a building, the adjusted location will most probably end up on the roof (even if there is room inside the building)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>v2.8</h3>
        <p>For CraftBukkit 1.7.9 or higher only!</p>
        <p>Please also read the change log for v2.8-beta-1, v2.8-beta-2 and v2.8-beta-3 below. There are some big changes that you need to be aware of!</p>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added bed blocks to those the Emerald Sonic should ignore</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Scoreboards no longer need OfflinePlayers (a Bukkit API change) &mdash; this means the plugin requires CraftBukkit 1.7.8 build #3049 or higher!</li>
            <li>Increased TARDIS mob farming range so that players will always teleport inside the TARDIS when riding a horse and clicking the door</li>
            <li>The plugin no longer sets <code>keepSpawnInMemory: false</code> in the Multiverse config for TARDIS worlds, as it sometimes prevents redstone doors from working &mdash; you will need to manually update your Multiverse settings if you have this problem</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed dematerialisation sound playing when it shouldn&rsquo;t</li>

        <h3>v2.8-beta-3</h3>
        <p style="color:#c00;">For CraftBukkit 1.7.8/9 only!</p>
        <p>Please also read the change logs for v2.8-beta-1 and v2.8-beta-2 below.</p>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added UUID support for Minecraft/CraftBukkit 1.7.8 changes due to the upcoming in-game name changing feature, more info here: <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/678-uuid-migration/">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/678-uuid-migration/</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Server must be <code>online-mode=true</code> in server.properties as player UUIDs are different when the server is in offline mode</li>
                    <li>When you first install a UUID compatible version, the plugin will automatically backup and update the TARDIS database with the new UUID fields</li>
                    <li>After the database update, the current records will be queried for a list of player names</li>
                    <li>From this list, the plugin will connect to the Mojang Accounts database and retrieve UUIDs for all the players in the list &mdash; because this requires a connection to the web it may hold up the server startup process for a few seconds (it depends how many Time Lords there are &mdash; in a recent test on a database of 118 players, it took 18 seconds and updated 1343 records)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added a message to the player if the TARDIS <em>Zero</em>Room world has not been created and they try to grow a Zero room</li>
            <li>Added the <code>wg_flag_set</code> and <code>external_gravity</code> options to the <code>/tardisadmin</code> command</li>
            <li>Added compatibility with the Project Rassilon plugin when using the Sonic Screwdriver&rsquo;s bio-scanning feature</li>
            <li>Added a black <code>wool_lights</code> preference &mdash; <code>/tardisprefs wool_lights [on|off]</code> to use wool instead of sponge when turning off the TARDIS lights and during malfunctions</li>
            <li>Added ‘Flag’ support to TARDIS WorldGuard compatibility
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>respect_worldguard</code> setting is no longer true or false</li>
                    <li>Valid values are <code>none</code> (same as what was previously false) and any <a href="http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldGuard/Regions/Flags#Flag_List">WorldGuard State flag</a></li>
                    <li>The default value is <code>build</code>, another common value will probably be <code>entry</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added a config option to allow T.I.P.S to expand to a possible 1600 slots
                <ul>
                    <li>The default is still 400, but can be changed in the config by setting <code>creation.tips_limit</code> to a multiple of 400 i.e. 800, 1200, 1600 &mdash; <code>/tardisadmin tips_limit [limit]</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>TARDISHorseSpeed has been updated for CraftBukkit 1.7.8</li>
            <li>The Artron Indicator only shows used, percent and remaining when travelling. To see the full charge and time lord levels, use the Artron Button on the console</li>
            <li>When using Multiverse new TARDIS worlds are set to <code>animalrate: 0</code> and <code>monstersrate: 0</code> instead of <code>animals: false</code>, <code>monsters: false</code>. This prevents farmed mobs from despawning
                <ul>
                    <li>To update existing TARDIS worlds, use the command <code>/tardisadmin modify mv</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In conjunction with the above, we now add WorldGuard regions with a higher priority to the farm, stable and village rooms to allow mob spawning in them (except for nasty monsters of course)</li>
            <li>Now properly getting and setting TARDIS mob names, and saddled pigs if necessary when farming</li>
            <li>The horse&rsquo;s direction is now set correctly when exiting the TARDIS from the stable room</li>
            <li>We are now using our own anti-build methods, as WorldGuard&rsquo;s do not achieve the desired result (this is relevant to the player &lsquo;build&rsquo; preference &mdash; <code>/tardisprefs build [on|off]</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>To update existing TARDIS worlds, use the command <code>/tardisadmin modify wg</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added &lsquo;Companion Build&rsquo; preference to the Sonic Screwdriver Player Preferences GUI</li>
            <li>Changed the messages when Advanced Console use is required</li>
            <li>You no longer have to click the output slot to generate a biome or preset disk</li>
            <li>Prevented the Emerald Sonic from scanning when clicking an interactable block (such as a door, button, chest etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where one of the TARDIS map files (<code>map_1966.dat</code>) was not copied to the TARDIS folder and consequently may be missing from the <em>server&rsquo;s main world/data</em> folder
                <ul>
                    <li>if <code>map_1966.dat</code> is missing, remove all the map files from the <em>server&rsquo;s main world/data</em> folder so that TARDIS will regenerate the map files</li>
                    <li>copy the new map files back to the <em>server&rsquo;s main world/data</em> folder</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where click-dragging in the Storage inventory upper slots allowed items to be stored there (that also became un-retrieveable)</li>
            <li>Fixed the Save Sign GUI opening when the player was in the TARDIS, but didn&rsquo;t enter via the door</li>
            <li>Fixed the custom TARDIS schematic not working</li>
            <li>Fixed mis-named player disks in the lists generated by the <code>/tardisrecipe</code> and <code>/tardisgive</code> commands</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.8-beta-2</h3>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added double plants for use in custom presets</li>
            <li>
                <p>Added &lsquo;Nations&rsquo; support to TARDIS Towny compatibility &mdash; the config will be updated automatically, and there are now 4 values for <code>respect_towny</code></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>none</code> &mdash; no Towny checking will take place at all, players can land in any town</li>
                    <li><code>wilderness</code> &mdash; players can only land in wilderness</li>
                    <li><code>town</code> &mdash; players can land in wilderness and in any town they are a
                        resident of</li>
                    <li><code>nation</code> &mdash; players can land in wilderness and in any town they are a
                        resident of, and any town which is in the same nation as the player&rsquo;s
                        town</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When using the <code>full_charge_item</code>, if the current Artron levels exceed a full charge, TARDIS no longer <em>reduces</em> an overcharged capacitor to a full charge and does&rsquo;t remove the <code>full_charge_item</code> from the player.</li>

                <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Both doors are toggled open when shift-clicking either door (most of the time, it can be a bit buggy). When exiting &mdash; if the preset has a door and the door is open &mdash; the player is teleported to the door location (instead of right outside the Police Box).</li>
            <li>The door must be closed to time travel</li>
            <li>Now using the correct Artron Energy values for the type of travel, instead of the &lsquo;random&rsquo; value everytime</li>

            <li>The plugin now checks there is sufficient energy to use the Exterior Rendering Room</li>
            <li>The plugin now checks the player has sufficient Artron Energy when using the save sign</li>
            <li>If ProtocolLib is enabled on the server, you can now just click the keyboard sign to edit it (rather than having to click it with another sign)</li>
            <li>The plugin is now stricter with the use of the <code>/tardis occupy</code> command &mdash; it only sets occupied if the player is IN the TARDIS or UNoccupied if outside</li>
            <li>Altered the Bukkit version checker so that the plugin will enable on MCPC+ servers</li>
            <li>The plugin now checks the player has permission to break the block with the Diamond Sonic Screwdriver</li>
            <li>The plugin now only equips the perception filter if the chest plate slot is empty</li>

            <li>Disk Storage only opens if it is the Time Lord&rsquo;s own TARDIS</li>
            <li>To list TARDISes for pruning, you now need to use the <code>/tardisadmin prunelist [days]</code> command</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="v26b3">v2.6-beta-3</h3>
        <p>What happened to <em>TARDIS v2.6-beta-2</em>, you might ask? It was rejected by Bukkit for having a non-compliant update checker. Perhaps an email advising developers of the change in policy would have been nice&hellip; but never mind here&rsquo;s beta 3 :)</p>
        <p>There are lots of changes in v2.6 &mdash; some of which are not compatible with previous TARDISes&hellip; please read this and the <a href="#v26b1">previous change log</a> carefully</p>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a Doctor Who 50th anniversary easter egg</li>
            <li>There are some new presets &mdash; TELEPHONE, SUBMERGED, FLOWER, CHALICE, WINDMILL, WELL, ANGEL, GRAVESTONE, CAKE, TOPSYTURVEY, SHROOM, CUSTOM and one other secret one</li>
            <li>Added the ability to add a custom preset &mdash; edit the <em>plugins/TARDIS/custom_preset.txt</em> file and restart the server. The file contains data for the new taller Police Box preset &mdash; you should be able to work it out from there (the sign <em>if used</em>, will need to be in the default location).</li>
            <li>Added a new setting to the Chameleon Circuit GUI &mdash; Biome Adaption &mdash; if this is turned on, a biome related preset will be selected automatically (if there is one)</li>
            <li>Added a command to remove the ARS sign to allow manual room growing in the ARS grid area <code>/tardis arsremove</code> &mdash; useful if your TARDIS was created before v2.6 and is not compatible with ARS (Note: adding it back after removal will potentially overwrite any manually grown rooms)</li>
            <li>Added tab auto-completion for player names added to the <code>/tardisadmin enter</code> and <code>/tardisadmin delete</code> commands</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New (larger sized console) schematics for better room growing and future ARS compatibility &mdash; many thanks to Lord_Rahl and <strong>killeratnight</strong> at mcnovus.net for the new designs</li>
            <li>All schematics updated with new piston doors &mdash; they now only open if there is a room on the other side &mdash; once again thanks to Lord_Rahl and killeratnight</li>
            <li>Some presets now have random attributes &mdash; for example the Party Tent and Flower change to a random colour, the Angel has different wing and head positions</li>
            <li>The Chameleon Circuit GUI no longer closes when you select a preset &mdash; you need to use the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; or &lsquo;Apply&rsquo; button (or just hit ESC on the keyboard)</li>
            <li>The SWAMP preset has changed to be more like a witches hut</li>
            <li>The TARDIS &lsquo;last use&rsquo; field is set upon TARDIS creation, and updated more often (not just when a Time Lord travels)</li>
            <li>The random destination button now selects a random location relative to the current location of the TARDIS preset (when travelling in the <em>same</em> world)</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardistravel biome [biome]</code> command now finds the closest biome relative to the current location of the TARDIS preset (and not the player&rsquo;s location)</li>
            <li>Removed bonus_chest from config, admin commands and builder</li>
            <li>Removed the update checker &mdash; plugin enabling should be quicker now anyway</li>
            <li>Light grey wool blocks (usually the floor blocks) in TARDIS consoles (except the EMERALD type) are now replaced with the player&rsquo;s preferred floor block (like rooms already do)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed TARDIS consoles not being removed in shared worlds</li>
            <li>Fixed room jettisoning being off by 1 in both x and z directions, and the grammar in the jettison message</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem with controls not being set correctly with the new piston door schematics</li>
            <li>Fixed TARDIS seed blocks returning a non-valid block after being broken</li>
            <li>Fixed incorrect amount of blocks being added to the condenser table</li>
            <li>Fixed TARDIS seed blocks returning a non-valid block after being broken</li>
            <li>Fixed doors, trapdoors and various other blocks popping off presets when they de/materialise</li>
            <li>Fixed under door and platform blocks not being removed when the TARDIS leaves a location</li>
            <li>Fixed DROPPERS getting the wrong data value when being grown in a room</li>
            <li>Fixed a conflict with the JSONArray class</li>
            <li>Fixed pets disappearing when the player tries to exit the TARDIS with them</li>
            <li>In the ARS GUI, both (anti)gravity well slots are reset when jettisoning said rooms</li>
            <li>Fixed a parse number error trying to update <em>lastuse</em> for players with <code>tardis.prune.bybass</code> perms</li>
            <li>Fixed the platform and underdoor blocks being left behind if they just replaced AIR</li>

            <li>Added <code>/tardis abort [task ID number]</code> command to stop a room growing
                <ul>
                    <li>When starting to grow the room, players are messaged the task ID number to use with the command</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If a player&rsquo;s TARDIS lamp preference is a redstone lamp, then the plugin sets the block under it to a redstone block, so that it is lit.
                <ul>
                    <li>There is an added benefit to this &mdash; the lamp will now flash on and off when the TARDIS de/re-materialises :)</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>

            <li>Horse speed can now be set when entering and exiting the TARDIS &mdash; this is a temporary fix until an Attributes API is added Bukkit &mdash; <em><strong>REQUIRES</strong></em> the <strong>TARDISHorseSpeed.jar</strong> plugin to be installed on the server (included in the ZIP download) &mdash; if you don&rsquo;t care about setting horse speed, you don&rsquo;t need to install it</li>
            <li>Better messaging when attempting to rescue a player</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardis occupy</code> command now sets the player UNOCCUPIED from any TARDIS (not just their own)</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The map files required for the TARDIS item recipes are now copied to the <em>plugins/TARDIS</em> folder &mdash; these <strong>MUST</strong> be put in the main server world&rsquo;s <em>data</em> folder in order for the recipes to work.</li>

            <li>Fixed various potential NPEs, including one when clicking an empty slot in the Admin Menu inventory GUI, and another in the Texture Pack changer if the player disconnected while switching</li>
            <li>Fixed the RAIL room offset (again)</li>
        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The four individual farm mob spawn locations are calculated from the one farm location, so your farm layout needs to pretty similar to the farm room  &mdash; each spawn point is 3 x 3 blocks away &mdash; see <a href="http://">images/docs/farmspawns.jpg</a></li>
                    <li>You need to click a fence post to set the RAIL room spawn point</li>

        <h3>v2.5-beta-1</h3>
        <p>First off a huge thank you to everyone who contributed ideas and caught bugs for this release &mdash; without your input the plugin wouldn &rsquo;t be where it is today. Special mention goes to <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/bootthanoo/">bootthanoo</a> whose ideas seem to strike the right chord with me and the plugin, but to everyone equally &mdash; keep the ideas rolling in :)</p>

                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>Time is set when exiting the TARDIS and reset back to server time when entering the TARDIS</li>
                    <li>Player time can be reset at any time by right-clicking air with a clock</li>
                    <li>Use the <code>/tardis update temporal</code> command to add it</li>
                    <li>Players need <code>tardis.temporal</code> permission to use it</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The default Police Box wall block and lamp are now configurable items and the sign and lamp can be turned off.
                <ul>
                    <li>The default TARDIS exterior //wall// block can now be set in config.yml &mdash; change <code>wall_id</code> and <code>wall_data</code> e.g. for blue wool it would be <code>wall_id: 35</code> and <code>wall_data: 11</code> &mdash; for iron block it would be <code>wall_id: 42</code> and <code>wall_data: 0</code></li>

                    <li>The TARDIS exterior //wall// block can be overridden by players by using the Chameleon Circuit i.e. using the <code>/tardis chameleon short</code> command while targeting the desired block</li>
                    <li>The TARDIS exterior //lamp// block can be overridden by players by using the <code>/tardisprefs</code> command e.g. <code>/tardisprefs lamp [id]</code> &mdash; you can limit the blocks that are allowed to be used by editing the <code>lamp_blocks</code> list of id numbers in blocks.yml</li>
                    <li>Whether the TARDIS exterior has a sign and lamp can be overridden by players by using the <code>tardisprefs</code> command e.g. <code>/tardisprefs plain [on|off]</code></li>
                    <li>This should allow servers to set a plain TARDIS as default (as seen in DW Series 7 finale)</li>
                    <li>If you don &rsquo;t care, just leave the settings at the defaults to have the plugin behave as it usually does</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added  a craftable TARDIS Locator

                <ul>
                    <li>The items are custom maps &mdash; three maps are supplied with in the ZIP download &mdash; put them in the main server world &rsquo;s //data// folder to use them (maps will probably change for final 2.5 release)</li>
                    <li>To see the recipes type <code>/tardisrecipe [l-circuit|m-circuit|s-circuit]</code></li>
                    <li>The Locator Circuit and Materialisation Circuit are required to craft the Stattenheim Circuit when <code>difficulty</code> is set to hard</li>

            <li>Added config options: <code>malfunction</code>, <code>malfunction_nether</code> and <code>malfunction_end</code> &mdash; if not set to <code>0</code> gives a chance of TARDIS malfunction when time travelling, deposting the player in a different location than expected &mdash; a small (configurable) chance it may be the Nether or The End, even if they are disabled in the config or the player doesn&rsquo;t have permission. There is an emergency landing SFX (Spout required). Lights will flicker and there will be smoke and nausea effects (only if the TARDIS is created after updating to this version…) &mdash; see <a href="malfunction.html">malfunction.html</a></li>

            <li>Added command <code>/tardisadmin prune [days]</code> &mdash; automatically delete TARDISes that have not been used for the specified number of days (last use is set by the player using the TARDIS handbrake)</li>
            <li>Added command <code>/tardisadmin prune list [days]</code> &mdash; check which TARDISes will be deleted &mdash; outputs to screen/console and also writes to file. There is also a <code>tardis.prune.bypass</code> permission &mdash; see <a href="prune.html">prune.html</a></li>

            <li>The bind command has been changed to <code>/tardisbind [bind type] [name]</code> &mdash; this means you can now bind buttons to players and TARDIS areas as well as saved locations and the hide, rebuild and home commands &mdash; <a href="bind-commands.html">bind-commands.html</a></li>

                once there you can still use <code>/tardis save [name]</code> to remember the destination (and bind it to a button)
                if a player uses <code>/tardistravel dest [save]</code> and the saved location is currently occupied, then they will be asked to use the <code>/tardistravel area [name]</code> command instead</li>
            <li>Fixed TARDISes finding parking spots outside a TARDIS area</li>
            <li>You can now no longer rebuild the TARDIS while you are inside it and a destination has been set but not travelled to</li>

            <li>The Gravity Well is now one block taller/deeper to accommodate growing rooms underneath the &lsquo;arboretum&rsquo; room</li>
            <li>The ICE blocks in the &lsquo;pool&rsquo; room are now thawed upon room completion</li>
            <li>Lamps are now all turned on correctly upon room completion</li>
            <li>Worlds in the config are now added/removed as necessary when using the <code>/tardisadmin reload</code> command</li>
            <li>Added a confirmation command <code>/tardis exterminate</code> with a configurable timeout period (<code>confirm_timeout</code>) when breaking the Police Box sign (deleting the TARDIS)</li>
            <li>New TARDIS worlds now have PVP set to false by default</li>
            <li>Added a TARDIS scanner &mdash; this can be a button or lever &mdash; use the <code>/tardis update scanner</code> command to add it. The scanner will tell you about the location of the current saved destination/current Police Box location (if no destination has been set). It includes information on the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The world and co-ordinates</li>
                    <li>Biome type</li>
                    <li>Time of day</li>
                    <li>Weather</li>
                    <li>Humidity</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added player preference to set the block used to grow room walls &mdash; use <code>/tardisprefs wall help</code> to see a list of available blocks. The preference is automatically set when creating the TARDIS &mdash; default, bigger and deluxe sizes are set to ORANGE_WOOL and the eleventh to LIGHT_GREY_WOOL if using LAPIS as the middle block (in the creation stack). Otherwise it is set the the material used for the middle block.</li>
            <li>If the config contains <code>debug: true</code>, rooms grow faster</li>
            <li>The TARDIS condenser now accepts most blocks and items for conversion. You get more energy for items of higher worth e.g. if the value of DIRT = 1, then a diamond = 200</li>
            <li>You can no longer use the <code>/tardis comehere</code> command to bring the Police Box to a predefined TARDIS area &mdash; this should stop potential overlaps and dupes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-8</h3>
        <p>Big thanks to <strong>vistaero</strong> for finding a whole bunch of bugs and making a video so we can fix them :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The default Artron Energy values have been adjusted &mdash; rename your old config file and let the plugin regenerate a new one if you want to see them</li>
            <li>Fixed some inconsistencies with the Emerald TARDIS</li>
            <li>You can no longer set a destination while the Handbrake is off &mdash; this includes using the random location button, any &lsquo;bound&rsquo; buttons, the save sign, and the <code>/tardistravel</code> commands</li>
            <li>If random location finding times out &mdash; due to the area defined by the repeater settings being protected by another plugin (such as WorldGuard) &mdash; then the player is messaged and no destination is saved</li>
            <li>The plugin no longer nags you about the TARDIS key if you click on a non-TARDIS iron door with blue wool on the top of it</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardisadmin include [world]</code> command</li>
            <li>The TARDIS initialisation charge is now 50% of the <code>full_charge</code> config value and not a static 500 units</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed <code>/tardisarea show</code> command throwing an error if no area name was supplied</li>
            <li>The platform (if there is one) is destroyed correctly when using <code>/tardis comehere</code></li>
            <li>Optimised some of the various TARDIS Listener classes to (hopefully) reduce server lag</li>
            <li>You can now add more than one gravity well to the TARDIS. Technically you can make one go up a level, but you&rsquo;ll have to be a bit creative&hellip;
                <ul>
                    <li>This breaks the current gravity wells so they will need updating</li>
                    <li>Added <code>/tardis gravity</code> command to update old gravity wells to the new format. Use the command while inside your TARDIS &mdash; changes should take effect immediately</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added some debug info for the EntityExplodeEvent Listener</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the <code>/tardis check_loc</code> and <code>/tardisarea show</code> marker block to SNOW instead of GLOWSTONE</li>
            <li>Made the Beacon recharge amount a percentage of the <code>full_charge</code> config value</li>
            <li>The handbrake can no longer be clicked on/off while the TARDIS is materialising &mdash; fixes dupe bug #1</li>
            <li>The TARDIS now uses the correct location to destroy the Police Box when a destination has been set but not used &mdash; fixes dupe bug #2</li>
            <li>If <code>materialise: true</code> is set in the config, the Police Box now rebuilds correctly &mdash; fixes dupe bug #3</li>
            <li>The Police Box is now impervious to FIREBALLs</li>
            <li>Multiverse no longer tries to adjust the TARDIS world spawn point (TARDIS sets it itself)</li>
            <li>Mistyping or using an invalid room name no longer throws an error</li>
            <li>if <code>give_key: true</code> is set in the config the TARDIS will give a key to players when entering the TARDIS as well as exiting, should they not have one in their inventory</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The precious blocks under the TARDIS beacon are now protected properly from harvesting after travelling for the first time<br />
                <strong>Note</strong> this will only be in effect for newly created TARDISs</li>
            <li>The spawn point of TARDIS worlds is now set inside the TARDIS, so no more falling to your death in the void if you die and respawn in your TARDIS.<br />
                <strong>Note</strong> this will only be in effect for newly created TARDISs + untested with MultiWorld plugin</li>
            <li>Improved messaging when clicking on the door and handbrake while travelling</li>
            <li>The plugin now properly respects the <code>give_key</code> config option</li>
            <li>The <code>full_charge</code> config value is now used where it should be</li>
            <li>The EMERALD/Eleventh TARDIS schematic now sets the handbrake block correctly &mdash; please delete the old schematic and CSV file</li>
            <li>You can no longer use the commands: <code>/tardis come here</code>, <code>/tardis home</code>, and <code>/tardis setdest [name]</code> when you are in a TARDIS</li>
            <li>You can no longer use any travel commands if you are the NOT the Time Lord of the TARDIS you are currently inside</li>
            <li>The Police Box platform gets properly destroyed (if present) when using the <code>/tardis direction</code> command</li>
            <li>The chunks that Police Boxes are in are now kept loaded &mdash; this is to prevent the Police Box from not being destroyed properly when time travelling. Once the Police Box is moved the chunks are allowed to unload normally again. You can check which chunks are kept loaded with the command <code>/tardisadmin chunks</code></li>
            <li>Police Box chunks are now saved to a text file (chunks.txt) when the plugin is disabled, and reloaded again when the plugin is next enabled</li>
            <li>Safe location finding has been improved, there should always be at least one clear block in front of the door</li>
            <li>TARDIS areas set up in the Nether now work correctly. Note this will only be in effect for newly created areas. The plugin now also checks that the area start and end blocks are at the same Y level</li>
            <li>If a TARDIS was created in its own world, then the plugin no longer bothers to destroy the actual TARDIS as the world is deleted anyway</li>
            <li>General code tidying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed bug with the <code>/tardisadmin list</code> command</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the <code>/tardisadmin config</code> command</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis unbind [save_name]</code> command to remove a destination that has been bound to a button with the <code>/tardis bind</code> command</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where rooms grew funny (with missing blocks) if you left the TARDIS world while it was growing. The plugin now keeps the chunks the room is growing in loaded until the process is complete</li>
            <li>Added a new room &mdash; workshop, seed block is <code>NETHER_BRICK</code></li>
            <li>Added a new TARDIS interior &mdash; use an <code>EMERALD_BLOCK</code></li>
            <li>Made TARDIS worlds not have any weather (if using Multiverse) + a couple of other MV options (Don&rsquo;t keep TARDIS world spawn in memory, don&rsquo;t allow portals in TARDIS worlds)</li>

            <li>Removed some unused config options (<code>protect_blocks</code> and <code>require_spout</code>)</li>
            <li>Fixed an error if the TARDIS schematic doesn&rsquo;t have the correct block in it for the charged creeper to spawn on.</li>
            <li>Fixed the TARDIS Police Box sometimes melting when it is materialising (whose idea was it to put a torch next to ICE blocks anyway?)</li>
            <li>Admins can now allow players to grow rooms in non-TARDIS worlds &mdash; however, the world must be called <strong>TARDIS_TimeVortex</strong>, and either be world type <code>FLAT</code> or use the TARDISChunkGenerator, and of course the player must have the permission <code>tardis.room</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-3b</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Schematics have been updated, please delete the old ones and let them regenerate!</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an Artron energy condenser &mdash; a chest that converts raw materials (DIRT, SAND, GRAVEL, COBBLESTONE and ROTTEN FLESH &mdash; May change to something rarer in final release!) to Artron energy &mdash; use the <code>/tardis update condenser</code> command after placing a chest.</li>
            <li>Added a new room type &mdash; a gravity well &mdash; this will let you make the TARDIS interior even bigger by providing a second level &mdash; use <code>/tardis room gravity</code> to build one &mdash; start with an empty room and place the seed block in the middle of the floor.</li>
            <li>Added a handbrake to the TARDIS console. This is what now initiates entry into the time vortex for all time travel operations.</li>
            <li>Fixed a Police Box duplication bug</li>
            <li>If no multi-world plugin (either Mulitverse or MultiWorld) is found, <code>create_worlds</code> is set to <code>false</code> in the config.</li>
            <li>Changed the random location method so that it returns a broader range of negative to positive values.</li>
            <li>Fixed TARDIS worlds not continuing to use the TARDISChunkGenerator</li>
            <li>Added no mob flags to Multiverse and MultiWorld configs for TARDIS worlds, so we don&rsquo;t have to rely on WorldGuard being on the server.</li>
            <li>Fixed a config error when excluding the TARDIS world as a time travel destination at creation time</li>
            <li>Fixed some wrong names in the config</li>
            <li>Made a TARDIS&rsquo; recharge status persistent over server restarts.</li>
            <li>Fixed the lightning listener throwing errors. Only allow natural lightning to charge the TARDIS if it not at a charging beacon.</li>
            <li>Now using prepared statements for all SQL queries so that we can handle world names with apostrophes in them.</li>
            <li>Renamed save-repeater to world-repeater (fixes <code>/tardis update save-repeater</code> which was broken)</li>
            <li>Saved destinations are now removed from the database when the TARDIS is deleted.</li>
            <li>Now bundled with the TARDISChunkGenerator in one ZIP file.</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Made the Artron energy <code>full_recharge_item</code> configurable</li>
            <li>TARDIS worlds are now NORMAL worlds (instead of THE_END), but are kept in perpetual night</li>
            <li>Fixed a couple of missing wool blocks in the &lsquo;Budget&rsquo; sized TARDIS</li>
            <li>The beacon base blocks in the TARDIS can no longer be broken and harvested</li>
            <li>If <code>create_worlds</code> is <code>false</code> in the config, players now get more Artron energy while time travelling, and can transfer it at anytime to the Artron Energy capacitor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v2.0-beta-1</h3>
        <p>WARNING &mdash; not yet suitable for public servers! Please wait for a stable release.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now have the plugin generate separate worlds for each TARDIS</li>
            <li>TARDISes now consume Artron Energy, and need to be recharged periodically. Artron energy is used to time travel, hide the TARDIS and grow rooms. Recharging occurs when the TARDIS is in the vicinity of beacon blocks that have been defined as recharge points by the server admin. Each TARDIS now contains an Artron Energy Capacitor which needs to be initialised when the TARDIS is first created.</li>
            <li>You can now grow rooms off the TARDIS console room. Room types include: passage ways, an arboretum, bedrooms, kitchens, libraries, pools, vaults and empty rooms. Rooms can be jettisoned to gain more power.</li>
            <li>Travel to the Nether and The End now requires a (configurable) minimum amount of Artron energy so that it is harder to travel there (like vanilla Minecraft, and also like in the Doctor Who episode &lsquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Wife&rsquo;).</li>
            <li>The TARDIS Police Box can be configured to materialise when re-entering a world after travelling in the time vortex.</li>
            <li>If the Towny plugin is installed on the server, the TARDIS can be configured to only land in wilderness.</li>
            <li>Added an in-built update checker (you can turn this off in the config).</li>
            <li>Now backwards compatible to at least Bukkit 1.2.4-R4.1, so now working with Tekkit server again! (And yes, you can use the Sonic Screwdriver as the TARDIS key).</li>
            <li>Database handling completely rewritten.</li>
            <li>Classes split into packages.</li>
            <li>Various code optimisations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>v1.9.3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The plugin now actually uses the chameleon config option. If <code>chameleon</code> is set to <code>false</code> all Police Boxes will be blue wool.</li>
            <li>Changed the event priority when checking if the Police Box blocks are being damaged</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardis comehere</code> command now checks the location to make sure it is not griefing existing blocks</li>
            <li>When teleporting to a SURVIVAL world flying is disabled (if using Multiverse or MultiWorld plugins)</li>
            <li>Removed some old fire/ignite prevention methods in favour of WorldGuard protection</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed random location finding. When <code>land_on_water</code> is set to <code>false</code> you now no longer land on water!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added back some default config options that had gone AWOL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.9</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First combined release by eccentric_nz and ewized :)</li>
            <li>Fixed chest removal when removing/deleting a TARDIS</li>
            <li>Added config option &mdash; <code>name_tardis: [true|false]</code> sets whether to add the player&rsquo;s name to the TARDIS Police Box sign</li>
            <li>When using the <code>/tardis update button</code> command (or replacing the button in its original position), the TARDIS console &lsquo;button&rsquo; can now be a stone button, a wooden button or a lever</li>
            <li>Added command <code>/tardis version</code> to display the version of TARDIS and CraftBukkit the server is running</li>
            <li>Updated Materials list to add latest 1.4.6 items</li>
            <li>Added co-ordinates to random location message</li>
            <li>Fixed some grammar in messages sent to player</li>

            <li>Police Box no longer drops a redstone torch when it is removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.8.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated for CraftBukkit 1.4.5 Recommended Build &mdash; DO NOT UPGRADE if you are using any lesser CraftBukkit build</li>
            <li>Changed the default value for <code>default_world_name</code> in the config so servers that haven&rsquo;t used a world name other than <em>world</em> don&rsquo;t get errors on random location finding</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardisadmin debug [true|false]</code> to toggle debug mode on and off</li>

        <h3>v1.8</h3>
        <p>Thanks to everyone who made suggestions or found bugs :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel is now possible to all three world environments &mdash; Overworld, Nether and The End. Overworld time travel is always available, but Nether and The End travel can be disabled in the config.</li>
            <li>There is now no longer a &lsquo;Save&rsquo; repeater on the TARDIS console &mdash; this has been replaced with an &lsquo;Environment&rsquo; selector.</li>
            <li>The 1-tick position will select a world with a random environment</li>
            <li>The 2-tick position will only select (Normal) Overworlds</li>
            <li>The 3-tick position will select from Nether worlds</li>
            <li>The 4-tick position will select The End worlds</li>
            <li>Due to there being no &lsquo;save&rsquo; repeater server administrators should run the command <code>/tardisadmin updatesaves</code> to convert any console saves into &lsquo;destinations&rsquo; (the same as those created by the /tardis setdest command.</li>
            <li>The <code>/tardis save</code> command has changed slightly as you no longer need to specify a slot number. Unlimited TARDIS destinations can now be saved using just: <code>/tardis save [mycoolsavename]</code></li>
            <li>A new sign can be added to the TARDIS interior &mdash; this is a &lsquo;save&rsquo; sign. First place a sign, then use the <code>/tardis update save-sign</code> command to initiate it.
                <ul>
                    <li>Right-clicking the sign will cycle through the TARDIS&rsquo;s saved destinations, as well as the TARDIS &lsquo;Home&rsquo;.</li>
                    <li>Right-clicking the sign while sneaking will set the TARDIS destination to the save currently shown on the sign.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardis removesave [savename]</code></li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardistravel home</code></li>
            <li>The Police Box can no longer be set on fire</li>
            <li>You can now stop the TARDIS landing on water with the config option <code>land_on_water: [true|false]</code></li>
            <li>You can now change the blocks that the TARDIS interior is constructed with.</li>
            <li>The material that gets used (replacing the orange wool) is determined by the middle block used when creating the TARDIS</li>
            <li>Not all materials are available, valid ones are: <code>LAPIS_BLOCK, STONE, DIRT, WOOD, SANDSTONE, WOOL, BRICK, NETHERRACK, SOUL_SAND, SMOOTH_BRICK, ENDER_STONE</code> and one other secret one!</li>
            <li>Data values are supported, so all wool colours, wood types etc are good to go</li>
            <li><code>LAPIS_BLOCK</code> will NOT give you a LAPIS interior, but the default orange wool</li>
            <li>Added extra WorldGuard flags so that TARDIS owners have access to chests and building (if not op)</li>
            <li>Added extra WorldGuard flags so that bats don&rsquo;t spawn in, and mobs can&rsquo;t damage the TARDIS</li>
            <li>Clearing the WorldGuard region when TARDIS is destroyed (had written the method, but forgot to call it!)</li>
            <li>Fixed (hopefully) the ghost/duplicate Police Box bug</li>
            <li>Actually optimised some code as well as adding new stuff :)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed errors when no arguments are supplied to the <code>/tardisprefs</code> and <code>/tardisarea</code> commands</li>
            <li>The block under the Police Box door is now a protected block</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed the WorldGuard soft-dependency issue, the plugin will no longer throw a wobbly when WorldGuard is not installed.</li>
            <li>Really, really fixed safe location finding this time</li>
            <li>Made it so you can only rename the TARDIS key item (as determined by the TARDIS config)</li>
            <li>Added config options to enable/disable WorldGuard &mdash; for inner TARDIS protection and for respecting WorldGuard regions created with another plugin &mdash; <code>use_worldguard: [true|false]</code> and <code>respect_worldguard: [true|false]</code></li>
            <li>Separated <code>/tardis</code> command into 5 separate commands:</li>
            <li><code>/tardis</code> &mdash; do stuff with your TARDIS</li>
            <li><code>/tardistravel</code> &mdash; go somewhere in your TARDIS</li>
            <li><code>/tardisprefs</code> &mdash; change your TARDIS preferences</li>
            <li><code>/tardisadmin</code> &mdash; change the TARDIS plugin configuration</li>
            <li><code>/tardisarea</code> &mdash; Set up predefined TARDIS travel areas</li>
            <li>As you can see the commands haven&rsquo;t really changed all that much, instead of <code>/command [argument]</code>, some commands are now <code>/commandargument</code>, the rest of the required arguments to the commands have not changed. Check the Commands page for the updated syntax</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed <code>/tardis comehere</code> command leaving a &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; police box behind (I think)</li>
            <li>Added command to rename the TARDIS key item &mdash; hold the key in your hand and type <code>/tardis namekey [your cool name here]</code></li>
            <li>Added &lsquo;Sonic Screwdriver&rsquo; name to TARDIS key item if it is automatically added to players inventory on time travel to a different world</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Fixed <code>/tardis admin area start [area_name_goes_here]</code> throwing an error if you forgot to give it a name</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the WorldGuard plugin is installed on the server, inner TARDISs are now protected with a WorldGuard Cuboid region that is owned by the player who created it. WorldGuard protection flags include: TNT, CREEPER<em>EXPLOSION, FIRE</em>SPREAD, LAVA<em>FIRE, LAVA</em>FLOW, LIGHTER, and BUILD, all set to DENY &mdash; NOTE Protection applies only to TARDISs created with this version of the plugin, AND will not extend to custom TARDIS extensions!</li>
            <li>Fixed Police Box sign not being protected after using the /tardis direction command</li>
            <li>Improved/fixed travel to The End &mdash; previously safe location finding would potentially send the the plugin into an endless loop and hang the server, if repeater travel distance settings were too high (The End is not very big!)</li>
            <li>Improved safe location finding &mdash; when the Police Box is facing in an EAST or WEST direction the rectangular safe search area is now oriented correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The TARDIS Police Box is now protected form TNT &amp; Creeper explosions plus Wither &amp; Ender Dragon damage</li>
            <li>Added ability to travel to The End, (End worlds will be loaded into the config) but time travel to The End is disabled by default &mdash; edit the config and make <code>the_end: true</code> to enable</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed not being able to remove a companion when there is only one in the list</li>

            <li>Never got uploaded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Compatible with latest CraftBukkit 1.4.2R0.2-SNAPSHOT</li>
            <li>Updated materials list to reflect new MC 1.4.2 additions</li>
            <li>Fixed the TARDIS &lsquo;griefing&rsquo; &mdash; blocks displaced by the police box are now replaced when the TARDIS leaves</li>
            <li>Check worlds in config are still active on the server when plugin starts up, remove from config if not (hopefully fixes random location finding not working for some players)</li>
            <li>Added command to save additional TARDIS destinations &mdash; look at destination block and use <code>/tardis setdest [name]</code></li>
            <li>Changed <code>/tardis list saves</code> command so that it lists all saved destinations (not just those saved in the TARDIS console)</li>
            <li>Added TARDIS &lsquo;areas&rsquo; &mdash; you can now set rectangular regions that you can either exclude players from landing in, or only allow certain players to land in. See the Areas page for more details on setting these up.</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis list areas</code> command to show preset areas</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis travel dest [name]</code> and <code>/tardis travel area [name]</code> commands</li>
            <li>Changed the default TARDIS key to a STICK as REDSTONE<em>TORCH</em>ON is a bit buggy when it comes to clicking on the top half of iron doors. The key can still set to any material in the TARDIS config (I use a GOLDEN_CARROT!)</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis home command</code> &mdash; saves the block location you are looking at to the &lsquo;home&rsquo; slot on the TARDIS console save-repeater.</li>
            <li>Added <code>/tardis hide command</code> &mdash; hides the TARDIS police box, use <code>/tardis rebuild</code> to show it again.</li>
            <li>Added permission node tardis.skeletonkey &mdash; allows admins/ops with this permission to enter any TARDIS</li>
            <li>Changed all permission nodes to be lowercase</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>v1.6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added different sized TARDIS interiors &mdash; The bottom block when creating a TARDIS determines the size &mdash; IRON block gives the current TARDIS, GOLD block gives a bigger TARDIS, DIAMOND block gives a deluxe TARDIS. Deluxe TARDIS schematic kindly provided by ewized.</li>
            <li>You can now use your own schematic files to build the inner TARDIS &mdash; see the <a href="schematics.html">Schematics</a> page for more info&hellip;</li>
            <li>A fix for the &lsquo;chameleon circuit exploit&rsquo; &mdash; the Police Box is now indestructible in SURVIVAL mode (except for the sign &amp; platform if there is one).</li>
            <li>Random location finding and <code>/tardis comehere</code> command now respects WorldGuard regions (if WorldGuard is enabled on server).</li>
            <li>New command <code>/tardis direction [north </code>
                <td><code>west</code></td>
                <td><code>south</code></td>
                <td><code>east]</code> allows you to change the direction the TARDIS police box is facing. 
            </li>
            <li>Exit and entry locations fixed, should not take any damage now.</li>
            <li>If inner door is moved and updated its new location is now used to determine the entry point to inner TARDIS.</li>
            <li>TARDIS now lands on snow properly.</li>
            <li>Removed &lsquo;Have not created TARDIS&rsquo; message when clicking on an iron door.</li>
            <li>This version will no longer allow you to update from a version 1.2.3 and below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>v1.5.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added Remote Control! You can now make your TARDIS come to the spot you are looking at with the command <code>/tardis comehere</code></li>
            <li>Added player preferences for turning Who quotes on and off <code>/tardis quotes [on </code>
                <td><code>off] </code>

            <li>Improvements to Chameleon Circuit &mdash; shouldn&rsquo;t be any AIR TARDISs anymore, also if a valid blending block can&rsquo;t be found directly beneath the TARDIS, it now checks the surrounding blocks</li>
        </ul>
