# Contributing to the TARDIS Wiki

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the TARDIS Wiki!

We appreciate any and all help! Feel free to grab a to-do from below as well, or do whatever you feel inclined to add!

## Wiki Layout

Most pages use Markdown to render into HTML, so as long as you're brushed up in [kramdown markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), you're good to go!

## Editing an existing page

Have a simple change to add? Maybe fix a typo or two? Simply edit the file and send the PR!

## Creating a page

Creating a page isn't all that difficult. Create a new file called `[page-path].md` (e.g. `contributing.md`), at the very top you __must__ put the following

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: page title # replace with an actual page title
---
```

This gives the page the layout so it's not just blank :p

If you want, feel free to add it to the sitemap as well, under the correct letter as well as in alphabetical order as preferred.
