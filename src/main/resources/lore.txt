Welcome, Timelord @p
It seems that you are without transport. This world contains the resources that will let you to recreate your lost TARDIS.

Here is a list of items you will need to collect or mine:
1 Log
1 Redstone Ore
9 Iron Ore
2-3 Lapis Lazuli Ore
8 Cobblestone
1-2 Coal Ore

Once you have your items, craft a furnace to smelt the iron. Craft an Iron Block, a Lapis Block, a Redstone Torch and a Stick.

Your crafted items should then be placed in the following order:
Bottom: Iron Block
Middle: Lapis Block
Top: Redstone Torch

Stand back and watch your new TARDIS materialise before your eyes! You can enter with your TARDIS key - the Stick you crafted earlier.

You still need power to travel the Time Vortex. Look for the Artron Energy Capacitor button (it's made of wood) and click it with your TARDIS key.
