/**
 * Security Protocol 712 is a security feature aboard the Doctor's TARDIS which causes the ship to dematerialise and
 * re-appear at a predetermined point in space and time without its pilot when activated. It can be programmed to be
 * triggered by different events or objects such as Sally Sparrow's DVDs or the activation of the echelon circuit. A
 * holographic recreation of the incumbent Doctor will be projected to inform anyone within the TARDIS of the protocol
 * being activated.
